##Easy C# support for ARToolKit 5 on Windows
This simple library integrates the ARWrapper into a C# library. The result is an easy to use C# layer for ARToolKit 5.

	Setup:
		- Install ARToolKit 5 for Windows from here. http://www.artoolkit.org/dist/artoolkit5/5.3/ARToolKit%20v5.3.1R2%20Setup%20(bin-win32-vs120).exe
		- Open the sample project (CSharpIntegrationTester)
		-- The sample alreay integrates the C# library. The C# library automatically searches for the environment variables ARTOOLKIT5_ROOT and locates the ARToolKit-Wrapper-DLL.
		- Run the CSharpIntegrationTester project and you should see the version number of ARToolKit5 in a command line window.
